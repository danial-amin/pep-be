# Railway Configuration for Backend Service
# This file configures how Railway deploys the backend API service
# 
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: In Railway dashboard, you MUST set:
# - Root Directory: backend
# - Dockerfile Path: Dockerfile
# 
# Without setting Root Directory to "backend", Railway will try to build from root
# and fail because the files are in the backend/ directory.

[deploy]
# Start command is handled by Dockerfile CMD, which uses PORT env var
# Railway automatically provides PORT environment variable
# Health check endpoint (both /health and /healthcheck are available)
